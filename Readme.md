# Slp Enforcer

A reimplementation of altf4's [libenforcer](https://github.com/altf4/libenforcer) in rust
for use in rwing and other tools written in compiled lands.

Slp Enforcer and libenforcer check slp (and slpz files in the case of slp enforcer)
for violations of the [SSBM controller ruleset guidelines](https://github.com/CarVac/MeleeConchRuleset/blob/main/ruleset.md).

Slp Enforcer is still in development. It currently only checks for travel time violations.
